# Salma Abass - Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am **Salma Abass**, a dedicated Mechatronics engineer with a strong background in **control systems**, **robotics**, and **programming**. After graduating as the **valedictorian** from the German University in Cairo (GUC), I am currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s degree in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Biomechanical Engineering** at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

This repository serves as a showcase of my personal and academic projects. Here, you'll find implementations of various technologies and systems that align with my interests in **automation**, **intelligent systems**, and **advanced robotics**.



## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### 1. [Automatic teeth-brushing robotic arm ](https://github.com/go52cay/salmaabass.github.io/tree/main/automatic%20teeth-brushing%20robot)
We developed a robotic arm designed to automate tooth brushingâ€”offering a reliable solution for individuals with limited mobility due to conditions such as cerebral palsy, motor neuron disease, or age-related impairments. This handy helper brings together 3D printing, SolidWorks, Arduino, MATLAB/Simulink, Simscape, and a few servo motors doing their best impression of a dental hygienist. It's personal care, with a techy twist.

**Technologies Used**: 3D printing, Arduino, MATLAB/Simulink, Simscape

### 2. [Cruise Control C++ Project](https://github.com/go52cay/salmaabass.github.io/tree/main/Cruise%20Control%20C%2B%2B%20Project)
This C++ project implements a PID-based cruise control system for a simplified car model, factoring in rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag. The system and PID controller are initially solved with an Euler method, then refactored into an object-oriented structure for modularity. Finally, performance optimization ensures efficient runtime. A blend of control theory and C++ programming for smooth, automated speed control.

**Technologies Used**: Matlab/Simulink, C++, Python,

### 3. [Capacitive Force Sensor](https://github.com/go52cay/salmaabass.github.io/tree/main/Capacitive%20Force%20Sensor%20Project)
This project presents the development and analysis of a capacitive-based force sensor utilizing ABS
(Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) material. The sensorâ€™s core principle lies in the conversion of physical changes induced by applied forces into measurable capacitance alterations within the sensorâ€™s circuitry.
**Technologies Used**: Solidworks, 3D printing, Ansys Simulation, PCB design

### 4. [INDI Control and Aircraft Landing System](https://github.com/go52cay/salmaabass.github.io/tree/main/INDI%20Control%20and%20Aircraft%20Landing%20System)
For my Bachelor's thesis at the University of Stuttgart, I researched Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) control techniques for aircraft automation, specifically in the context of automated landing procedures. Here you will find the Final Thesis.

**Technologies Used**: MATLAB, Simulink, Flight Dynamics, Control Theory, XFLR5 Analysis

### 5. [Metal Separation ](https://github.com/go52cay/salmaabass.github.io/tree/main/Metal%20Separation%20Project)
The main objective of this project is to separate metallic materials from non-metallic ones by integrating electronics (relyas and switches) and pneumatics(double acting cylinders). We even MacGyvered an electromagnet from an old transformer by isolating the primary coilâ€”because, surprise, the electromagnet was pricier than the whole project! Talk about making do with what you've got!.

**Technologies Used**: Solidworks, Fluidsim, Soldering

### 6. [Firefighting Robot Prototype](http://github.com/go52cay/salmaabass.github.io/tree/main/Firefighter%20Protoype)

This prototype is designed to detect and tackle small fires before they escalate. Using six IR photodiodes for 360Â° flame detection, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance, and a DC pump for extinguishing, itâ€™s controlled by an ATmega328p microcontroller, all integrated on a custom-designed PCB. Simple, scrappy, and ready to save the day.

**Technologies Used**: PCB design, Matlab, C programming Language

### 7. [Heat Exchanger Temperature Prediction with Machine Learning](https://github.com/go52cay/salmaabass.github.io/tree/main/Heat%20Exchanger%20Temperature%20Prediction%20with%20Machine%20Learning)

This machine learning model predicts the outflow temperature of a heat exchanger system based on the last 50 target temperatures. The model is trained on time-series data from multiple system responses, and it also estimates the 5th and 95th percentiles to assess the risk of extreme temperature fluctuations that could damage the system.

**Technologies Used**: Python, Pytorch, Machine Learning
