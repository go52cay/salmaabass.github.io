# Salma Abass - Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am **Salma Abass**, a dedicated Mechatronics engineer with a strong background in **control systems**, **robotics**, and **programming**. After graduating as the **valedictorian** from the German University in Cairo (GUC), I am currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s degree in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Biomechanical Engineering** at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

This repository serves as a showcase of my personal and academic projects. Here, you'll find implementations of various technologies and systems that align with my interests in **automation**, **intelligent systems**, and **advanced robotics**.



## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### 1. [Automatic teeth-brushing robotic arm ](https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-path-tracking-robot)
We developed a robotic arm designed to automate tooth brushingâ€”offering a reliable solution for individuals with limited mobility due to conditions such as cerebral palsy, motor neuron disease, or age-related impairments. This handy helper brings together 3D printing, SolidWorks, Arduino, MATLAB/Simulink, Simscape, and a few servo motors doing their best impression of a dental hygienist. It's personal care, with a techy twist.

**Technologies Used**: 3D printing, Arduino, MATLAB/Simulink, Simscape

### 2. [Autonomous Path Tracking Robot](https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-path-tracking-robot)
A ROS-based robot capable of performing object detection and path tracking. This project focuses on designing algorithms for autonomous navigation and control using sensor inputs.

**Technologies Used**: ROS, Python, OpenCV, Sensor Fusion, Path Planning

---

### 3. [Capacitive Force Sensor](https://github.com/your-username/hvac-control-system)
This project presents the development and analysis of a capacitive-based force sensor utilizing ABS
(Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) material. The sensorâ€™s core principle lies in the conversion of physical changes induced by applied forces into measurable capacitance alterations within the sensorâ€™s circuitry.
**Technologies Used**: Solidworks, 3D printing, Ansys Simulation, PCB design

---

### 4. [INDI Control and Aircraft Landing System](https://github.com/your-username/aircraft-landing-system)
For my Bachelor's thesis at the University of Stuttgart, I researched Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) control techniques for aircraft automation, specifically in the context of automated landing procedures. Here you will find the Final Thesis.

**Technologies Used**: MATLAB, Simulink, Flight Dynamics, Control Theory, XFLR5 Analysis

---

### 5. [Metal Separation ](https://github.com/your-username/pde-arena)
The main objective of this project is to separate metallic materials from non-metallic ones by integrating electronics (relyas and switches) and pneumatics(double acting cylinders). We even MacGyvered an electromagnet from an old transformer by isolating the primary coilâ€”because, surprise, the electromagnet was pricier than the whole project! Talk about making do with what you've got!.

**Technologies Used**: Solidworks, Fluidsim, Soldering

---
### 6. [Firefighting Robot Prototype](https://github.com/your-username/pde-arena)

This prototype is designed to detect and tackle small fires before they escalate. Using six IR photodiodes for 360Â° flame detection, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance, and a DC pump for extinguishing, itâ€™s controlled by an ATmega328p microcontroller, all integrated on a custom-designed PCB. Simple, scrappy, and ready to save the day.

**Technologies Used**: PCB design, Matlab, C programming Language
