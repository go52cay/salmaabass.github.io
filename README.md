# Salma Abass - Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am Salma Abass, a dedicated Mechatronics engineer with a strong background in control systems, robotics, and programming. After graduating as the valedictorian from the German University in Cairo (GUC), I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Biomechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

This repository serves as a showcase of my personal and academic projects. Here, you'll find implementations of various technologies and systems that align with my interests in automation, intelligent systems, and advanced robotics.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### 1. [Autonomous Path Tracking Robot](https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-path-tracking-robot)
A ROS-based robot capable of performing object detection and path tracking. This project focuses on designing algorithms for autonomous navigation and control using sensor inputs.

**Technologies Used**: ROS, Python, OpenCV, Sensor Fusion, Path Planning
